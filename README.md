# Kaggle-clothes-recognition-competition

In this competition, you I had to predict the class of clothing by its image (FashionMNIST dataset), a total of 10 classes of clothing.

Recall that this is called a multiCLASS classification problem.

**The quality metric**

To assess the quality of a neural network in this competition, the metric Classification Accuracy is used: for each class, the proportion of correct objects is taken and then the arithmetic mean is taken from this.

**The results of the competition**

I managed to achieve 20th place out of 359 (Top 6%).
